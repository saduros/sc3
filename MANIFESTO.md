# Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew Manifesto

_Fork to "sign" or propose improvements!_

We are a small group of aspiring web developers and journalists based in Chicago who meet regularly to learn basic web skills and work on data journalism and civic technology projects.

Fluency with the web and information technology is a critical, marketable job skill. We teach each other practical tech skills that help us advance professionally.

We rarely have enough understanding of the systems that govern our lives. Data journalism helps us learn about, interrogate and improve those systems. 

Asking questions about issues, systems, and institutions that affect our community is a form of civic engagement. We explore our world with code, research, design, and storytelling. 

Learning to make web sites and applications requires access to some basic resources. We steer new participants without these resources to places and programs where they can get a free or cheap laptop, learn basic computer literacy, and obtain adequate Internet access.

Technology projects are about more than engineering. We welcome a wide variety of skills and skill levels. We work on projects that benefit from a diversity of skills.

Learning to code is learning to communicate. We emphasize fundamentals like task management, troubleshooting, and version control over specialized skills.

Open data only tells part of the story. We seek to liberate data from obscure sources, legacy systems and with public disclosure requests. We analyze and summarize data to make it more useful. We republish data on the web using standard, open formats.

Everyone benefits from transparency. We share our work by publishing our projects with open source licensed code and Creative Commons licensed content. 

Many real world processes have multiple, intertwined data collection and management steps. We research, map out, and describe complex systems.

The demographics of the technology industry does not represent society, which makes it that much harder to create technology that is responsible and humane. We organize for diversity by recruiting outside of the mainstream tech industry and through a gender equal leadership policy. 

People rarely have enough agency over the systems that govern our lives. We use participatory, consensus-based governance to practice democracy.

Consistent face-to-face interaction in a safe space is the best way to collaborate and encourage long term learning. We meet weekly in an accessible location.

Learning software development is an overwhelmingly popular subject. We aim to keep our group small while hatching new projects and working with similar groups around the world.
